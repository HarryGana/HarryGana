I am an Electrical/Computer Engineer and work at the national radio station and head the online ICT unit. I have managed a couple of social media accounts as well as that of my Organisation account.
What I have found out is that pictures or good graphics attracts more attention that just words. Any message you want to push out, to get good view or attraction you need to give it a good look.
Also when it comes to user interaction to a website or application. The feel, looks and user friendliness matters if people will return back to it or not and in the light of all these, I know it is imperative I learn design help give viewers a good experience.
Userâ€™s experience is important because it tries to fulfill the user's needs. It aims to provide positive experiences that keep users loyal to the product or brand. Additionally, a meaningful user experience allows you to define customer journeys on your website that are most conducive to business success.
A well packaged product sells better than its competitors.
